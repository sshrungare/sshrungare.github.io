    <h1>Data Modeling Techniques</h1>
    <p>Data modeling is the process of creating a conceptual representation of data and defining the relationships between data elements. It is an essential step in database design and can also be used for predictive modeling, machine learning, and other applications.</p>
    
    <h2>Entity-Relationship Model</h2>
    <p>The entity-relationship (ER) model is a popular data modeling technique used to represent entities and their relationships in a graphical way. The ER model consists of entities, attributes, and relationships. Entities are represented as rectangles, attributes are represented as ovals, and relationships are represented as diamonds. The following diagram shows an example of an ER model:</p>

    <h2>Relational Model</h2>
    <p>The relational model is a data modeling technique that represents data as tables or relations. Each table represents an entity and each row represents a record or instance of that entity. The columns of the table represent the attributes of the entity. Relationships between entities are represented using foreign keys. The following diagram shows an example of a relational model:</p>

    <h2>Dimensional Model</h2>
    <p>The dimensional model is a data modeling technique used for data warehousing and business intelligence. It represents data as facts and dimensions. Facts are numerical values that represent a business event, such as sales or revenue. Dimensions are the characteristics of the event, such as time, location, or product. The following diagram shows an example of a dimensional model:</p>
